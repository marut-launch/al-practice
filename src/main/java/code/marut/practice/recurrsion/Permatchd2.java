/*
Hero has a simple undirected graph. (Simple means that each edge connects two different vertices, and each pair of vertices is connected by at most one edge.)
A graph is considered pretty if it is a simple undirected graph in which each connected component contains an even number of edges.
You are given the adjacency matrix of Hero's graph as a String[] graph. ('Y' means that the two vertices are connected by an edge, 'N' means that they aren't.)
Change Hero's graph into a pretty graph by adding as few edges as possible. Return the minimum number of edges you have to add, or -1 if Hero's graph cannot
 be changed into a pretty graph.
Class:	Permatchd2
Method:	fix
Parameters:	String[]
Returns:	int
Method signature:	int fix(String[] graph)
(be sure your method is public)
Notes
-	Don't forget that the graph you'll obtain after adding the edges must still be simple.
Constraints
-	n will be between 1 and 50, inclusive.
-	graph will contain exactly n elements.
-	Each element in graph will contain exactly n characters.
-	Each character in graph will be either 'N' or 'Y'.
-	For all valid i graph[i][i] will be equal to 'N'.
-	For all valid i, j graph[i][j] will be equal to graph[j][i].
